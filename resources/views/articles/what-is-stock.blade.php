    A stock is a general term used to describe the ownership certificates of any company. A share, on the other hand, refers to the stock certificate of a particular company. Holding a particular company's share makes you a shareholder.

<p>Stocks are of two typesâ€”common and preferred. The difference is while the holder of the former has voting rights that can be exercised in corporate decisions, the later doesn't. However, preferred shareholders are legally entitled to receive a certain level of dividend payments before any dividends can be issued to other shareholders.</p>
