## What is a 'Stock'?

A stock is a type of security that signifies ownership in a corporation and represents a claim on part of the corporation's assets and earnings.

There are two main types of stock: 
* common
* preferred. 

Common stock usually entitles the owner to vote at shareholders' meetings and to receive dividends. 

Preferred stock generally does not have voting rights, but has a higher claim on assets and earnings than the common shares. 

For example, owners of preferred stock receive dividends before common shareholders and have priority in the event that a company goes bankrupt and is liquidated.


### BREAKING DOWN 'Stock'

A holder of stock (a shareholder) has a claim to a part of the corporation's assets and earnings. In other words, a shareholder is an owner of a company. Ownership is determined by the number of shares a person owns relative to the number of outstanding shares. For example, if a company has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding and one person owns 100 shares, that person would own and have claim to 10% of the company's assets.

### Note

Stocks are the foundation of nearly every portfolio. Historically, they have outperformed most other investments over the long run.
